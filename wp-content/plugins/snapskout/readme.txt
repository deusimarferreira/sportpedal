Snap Skout's free social sharebar plugin features popular social icons, including Skout. Skout is the easiest way to find the best deals and info.
== Description ==
The free Snap Skout social sharebar features the most popular social icons
(Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest Google+, Reddit, Tumblr and Skout).
It's the only social sharebar to include the all-new Skout button.
When activated, the Skout button compiles the best of the web from leading offer
providers and advertisers – such as Groupon, LivingSocial, Yelp and Gilt –
to deliver highly-targeted deals and offers directly into an online reading
experience, at exactly the right time and place. The offers are displayed when
the user hovers over the red Skout button in your sharebar.

Through Snap Skout’s recommended offers engine, publishers can connect with
engaged readers and generate new revenue – without having to worry about
overwhelming them with irrelevant ads.
